          <p>Along the southwest coast of what is now Alaska, the Yup’ik people call various villages on the Yukon River, known as Kwiqpak in Yup’ik, home (Ayunerak et al. 2014). As an Inuit group they have lived in Alaska for thousands of years, forming their own cultural identity with shared beliefs and practices. Many settlements, established hundreds of years ago, have become the Yup’ik villages of today.</p>

          <p>First colonized by Russia in 1741, Alaska was sold to the United States of America in 1867 (Harvard Project 2008). The Indian Reorganization Act (IRA) of 1934 was used to create formal reserves similar to the Native American reservations of the lower 48 states, but of the six established, only one still exists today. Due to the discovery of oil and the new statehood of Alaska, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) of 1971 created multiple for-profit corporations, the Alaska Native Corporations (ANCs) and Alaska Native Village Corporations (ANVCs), of which Alaska Natives became shareholders and were able to vote to acquire land (Harvard Project 2008). This was done so that the land is fee simple (privately owned), meaning that there is a lack of restrictions on land use, allowing for the extraction of natural resources.  While this act did not affect land owned by Alaska Natives through previous allotment, land conveyed to tribes and villages through these corporations is not considered to be part of Indian Country, meaning that the land has no significant use restrictions and that tribes have limited power to exercise jurisdiction over non-tribe members on this land (Forbes 2023).</p>
          <p>Due to ANCSA, tribal membership in Alaska is defined based on villages rather than tribal identity, unlike the rest of the USA. However, this definition by the government complicates that there are shared Indigenous identities, as can be seen with the Yup’ik. Historically they did have permanent settlements, but also traveled to various camps for seasonal harvesting. Many families would migrate, following different food sources with this seminomadic lifestyle (Ayunerak et al. 2014). Both the previous Allotment Act and ANCSA are an attempt to recognize Native land claims and respect this migration, while also settling what land is owned and can be used by the state of Alaska (Forbes 2023).  Hunting, gathering and fishing are still an integral part of subsistence in contemporary Yup’ik populations, but many now live a more settled lifestyle in the established villages (Harvard Project 2008; Ayunerak et al. 2014).</p>

	          <h3>How to Embed Video</h3>
        <hr>
          <p> Videos are also a good source of information, and can make your web page more interesting to look at. Your first option for sharing videos is to link out to a video hosting service like YouTube or Vimeo. But, oftentimes, you will want the video directly in your web page. You can do this by either emedding from a video service, or by putting a video file in your repository. There are advantages and disadvantages to both.</p>

            <p> Embedding from a video hosting service like YouTube is convienant, and doesn't take up any space on your server or github account. Here is how to embed a YouTube video into your project file!</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Go to the YouTube video that you want to embed</li>
              <li>Select Share</li>
              <li>copy the embed code wrapped in an "iframe"(and start the video later if you wish)</li>
              <li>Paste the web page where you want it in your web page.</li>
            </ul>
          <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SmI2kQy2Xh8?start=60" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

          <p> If you have your own mp4 video that you want to embed into your web page, without linking to it on YouTube, you can do that too. This has the advantage of not giving YouTube rights to your video, while also making sure that you video will not be taken down from the internet (because you'll refer to it in your img folder (if you were a super stickler, you could create a video folder and refer to it in there.))</p>
            <video width="320" height="240" controls>
              <source src="video/movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
              <source src="video/movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
              Your browser does not support the video tag.

        <h3>Community Action</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>The Yup’ik Women’s Coalition (YWC) is a nonprofit organization that is working to end violence against women and children through culturally relevant education and programs. According to their website, this includes the strengthening of traditional Yup’ik beliefs and teachings. They serve various communities along the Yukon River, including the village of Emmonak (YWC n.d.). This is where the Emmonak Women’s Shelter is based, providing a safe place from domestic violence for women and children from the surrounding villages:</p>
        <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/83089663?h=94ea82938c" width="500" height="315" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>Domestic abuse has become increasingly common in Yup’ik communities, especially in connection with how prolific alcoholism has become (Andre 2013). Due to the insufficiency of law enforcement, especially in rural areas, the shelter has worked to train “victim resource advocates” who work to connect those who have experienced violence with the shelter and other resources. Often, these villages do not have roads that connect them to other communities, and many women do not want to go to law enforcement, so these advocates will take women and children into their homes in emergency situations. Unfortunately, this can create dangerous situations if the perpetrator of the violence decides to come for the family (Stremple 2023). The women’s shelter then gives families a place to stay and have a sense of community with others going through the same hardships (Andre 2013).  In Yup’ik culture, community and kinship are very important, but due to assimilation efforts like the boarding schools many of these values have been lost over the generations. Yupiit (the plural of Yup’ik) means “real people of the land”, and in Yup’ik belief humans and other living beings were created by the spirit of the universe, Ellam Yua. Belief in Ellam Yua teaches that all living things need to be respected (Ayunerak et al. 2014).</p>
